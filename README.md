React Native: The core framework used to build the mobile application, enabling me to write the app in JavaScript and render it natively on both iOS and Android.
Expo: A powerful toolset that streamlined the development process, providing easy setup, development, and testing.
React Navigation: Used to implement a bottom tab navigation, allowing users to easily switch between different screens in the app.
React Native Vector Icons: Integrated to provide intuitive and visually appealing icons for the navigation tabs.
Custom Theming: Implemented light and dark theme switching to enhance user experience and accessibility.
Development Process
Setup and Configuration:

Initialized the project with Expo.
Configured navigation using React Navigation and created a bottom tab navigator.
Screen Development:

Created multiple screens: Home, Cards, Statistics, and Settings.
Ensured each screen followed the design mockup and used custom components where necessary.
Theming:

Developed a theme provider to handle light and dark modes.
Applied conditional styling based on the active theme, providing a seamless theme-switching experience.
Icon Integration:

Utilized MaterialCommunityIcons to add meaningful icons to each tab in the bottom navigation.
Ensured icons were correctly sized and colored according to the design specifications.
Testing and Debugging:

Tested the app extensively on both iOS and Android devices using Expo Go.
Fixed bugs and refined the user interface to ensure a smooth and consistent user experience.
By combining these technologies and following a structured development process, I was able to create KaleApp, a functional and user-friendly mobile application that meets the requirements of my assignment.
